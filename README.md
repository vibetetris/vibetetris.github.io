**Prompt:**

Build a Tetris game using an html canvas and js.

Features:  
Next piece display  
High score (saved in local storage)  
Lines display  
A level display  
A level selector screen (levels 1-10)  
The level increases by 1 every 10 lines until it reaches 10.  
Higher level = pieces fall faster  
Ensure responsiveness and control compatibility with mobile devices (touch controls)  
  
Code style:  
You can leverage modern JavaScript features. Write well-structed and organized code. In your code comments focus on explaining the "why" behind your code rather than the "how." (although don't overdo it)
